## Warning: Highly Experimental

Everything in this repository is highly experimental. We're testing out all kinds of things, from ES6 to a new renderer. Unless you're part of the development team please don't open issues or PRs here yet.

We don't anticipate a release until Summer 2015.

We are asking for suggestions and feedback in [this forum thread](http://www.html5gamedevs.com/topic/7949-the-phaser-3-wishlist-thread/) so be sure to add your voice.
